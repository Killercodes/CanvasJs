Blocking Web Request perdoamin
====

To block a web request using a service worker, you can use the fetch event in the service worker to intercept network requests and return a custom response. You can filter the domains by comparing the requested URL against an array of domains.

Here's an example of how you can block network requests for a list of domains using a service worker:

```js
// Define an array of domains to block
const blockedDomains = ['example.com', 'example.net'];

// Listen for the fetch event in the service worker
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  const requestUrl = new URL(event.request.url);
  const requestDomain = requestUrl.hostname;

  // If the request domain is in the blockedDomains array, return a custom response
  if (blockedDomains.includes(requestDomain)) {
    event.respondWith(new Response('Blocked by service worker'));
  }
});


```
In this example, the blockedDomains array contains a list of domains to block. When a network request is made, the service worker checks if the requested URL's hostname matches any of the domains in the blockedDomains array. If a match is found, the service worker responds with a custom response of "Blocked by service worker", effectively blocking the request.

Note that this example is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used to block actual network requests without proper authorization.


To run a service worker on a website you're browsing, you need to register the service worker in the website's script. Here are the steps:

1. Create a separate JavaScript file for your service worker and write your code there. Let's call it sw.js.

2. In your website's script, register the service worker by calling the navigator.serviceWorker.register() method. This should be done in the main script that is loaded on the page

```js
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js').then(function(registration) {
      console.log('ServiceWorker registration successful with scope: ', registration.scope);
    }, function(err) {
      console.log('ServiceWorker registration failed: ', err);
    });
  });
}


```

This code checks if the browser supports service workers and registers sw.js if it does.

3. Once the service worker is registered, it will start running in the background. You can use it to intercept and modify network requests, cache resources, and more.
Note that service workers only work over HTTPS or on localhost, due to security reasons.

## Browser Extension
But you can use service workers in a browser extension. In fact, many browser extensions use service workers to perform background tasks and provide offline support. Service workers can be registered and used in a browser extension just like on a regular website. However, keep in mind that service workers in a browser extension have access to different APIs and resources compared to a regular website

To use a service worker in a browser extension, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a background.js file in your extension's directory.

2. Add the following code to your manifest.json file to specify that the background.js file should be used as the background script for your extension:
```json
"background": {
  "scripts": ["background.js"],
  "persistent": false
}
```
The persistent property is set to false to indicate that the service worker should not remain active when the extension is closed.

3. In your background.js file, register your service worker using the navigator.serviceWorker.register() method:
```js
// List of blocked domains
const blockedDomains = ['example.com', 'example.net'];

// Listen for the onBeforeRequest event
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
  // Callback function to block the request
  function(details) {
    return {cancel: true};
  },
  // Filter object
  {urls: blockedDomains.map(domain => `*://*.${domain}/*`)},
  // Extra options
  ['blocking']
);

```
4. Make sure your sw.js file is in the same directory as your background.js file.

5. You can now use the service worker in your extension as you would on a website. Note that you may need to modify your service worker code to work with the context of the extension.

For example, if you want to intercept requests made by the extension, you can use the chrome.webRequest API instead of the FetchEvent API.

In a browser extension, you would use a content script to manipulate the website's DOM and block requests from certain domains.

Here is an example of how you can modify the background.js file to use a content script to block requests from the domains in the blockedDomains array:

```js
// Define the blocked domains
const blockedDomains = ['example.com', 'example.net'];

// Listen for requests and block those from blocked domains
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
  function(details) {
    if (blockedDomains.some(domain => details.url.includes(domain))) {
      return {cancel: true};
    }
  },
  {urls: ["<all_urls>"]},
  ["blocking"]
);

// Inject a content script to block requests from the domains
chrome.tabs.onUpdated.addListener(function(tabId, changeInfo, tab) {
  if (changeInfo.status === 'complete') {
    chrome.tabs.executeScript(tabId, {
      code: `(${blockRequests})(${JSON.stringify(blockedDomains)})`
    });
  }
});

// Content script to block requests
function blockRequests(blockedDomains) {
  const observer = new MutationObserver(mutations => {
    mutations.forEach(mutation => {
      mutation.addedNodes.forEach(node => {
        if (node.tagName === 'SCRIPT') {
          const domain = new URL(node.src).hostname;
          if (blockedDomains.includes(domain)) {
            node.remove();
          }
        }
      });
    });
  });
  observer.observe(document, {childList: true, subtree: true});
}

```
This code listens for all requests and blocks those from the domains in the blockedDomains array. It also injects a content script into the webpage that observes changes to the DOM and removes any script elements that load from a blocked domain.

To use this code, you would need to include it in your extension's background.js file and declare the appropriate permissions in the manifest.json file.


## Load and Enable 

To load and enable the extension with the updated background.js file that blocks certain domains, follow these steps:

1. Open Google Chrome and go to the "Extensions" page by clicking on the three dots in the top right corner and selecting "More tools" > "Extensions".
2. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner of the page.
3. Click on the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner of the page.
4. Select the folder where the extension files are stored (including the updated background.js file).
5. The extension should now be loaded and enabled, and will block any requests to the domains specified in the blockedDomains array.

> **Note:** If you make any changes to the background.js file while the extension is running, you will need to reload the extension on the "Extensions" page for the changes to take effect.
