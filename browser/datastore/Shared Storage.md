Shared Storage
===

Shared storage in Chrome refers to a feature that allows different extensions to share data between them. This means that data stored in the shared storage can be accessed and modified by multiple extensions, rather than being limited to just one extension.

Shared storage is typically used in scenarios where multiple extensions need to collaborate or exchange data. For example, if you have two extensions that work together to provide some functionality, they may use shared storage to exchange information about their state or settings.

Shared storage is implemented using the Chrome storage API, which provides a set of methods for storing and retrieving data in the shared storage area. This API is similar to the local storage and session storage APIs, but with the added ability to share data between extensions.



In Chrome, Shared Storage refers to the storage space that can be shared among different extensions and even between extensions and websites. The shared storage is implemented using the chrome.storage API, which provides a simple interface to store and retrieve key-value pairs.

Here is an example code in JavaScript to perform CRUD operations on shared storage:

```js
// Initialize shared storage
const sharedStorage = chrome.storage.sync;

// Create or update data
sharedStorage.set({key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2'}, () => {
  console.log('Data created/updated');
});

// Retrieve data by key
sharedStorage.get('key1', (data) => {
  console.log(`Value of key1: ${data.key1}`);
});

// Retrieve all data
sharedStorage.get(null, (data) => {
  console.log('All data:');
  console.log(data);
});

// Delete data by key
sharedStorage.remove('key2', () => {
  console.log('Data deleted');
});


```
In this example, we are using chrome.storage.sync to initialize the shared storage. We can also use chrome.storage.local if we want the data to be stored locally instead of being synced across devices.

We can create or update data in the shared storage using the set() method, passing an object with key-value pairs and a callback function to be executed after the data is saved.

We can retrieve data by key using the get() method, passing the key and a callback function to be executed with the retrieved data.

We can retrieve all data in the shared storage using the get() method with null as the key.

We can delete data by key using the remove() method, passing the key and a callback function to be executed after the data is deleted.
